# What do Product Managers Do?

Product managers are responsible for overseeing the development and launch of a product. They act as the bridge between the engineering team and the business team, ensuring that the product meets both technical and business requirements.

Their responsibilities can vary depending on the company and product, but some common tasks include:

1. Conducting market research and analysis to identify customer needs and market trends. This is one of the most critical roles of a product manager because it helps them understand the customer's needs and requirements. This understanding helps them determine what features to include in the product and what market trends to follow.
2. Defining the product strategy and roadmap based on the research and analysis. After conducting market research, a product manager must create a product strategy and roadmap. This strategy outlines the product's goals, target market, and how the product will compete with other similar products in the market. The roadmap, on the other hand, outlines the product's plan for development, testing, and launch.
3. Collaborating with the engineering team to develop the product and ensure it meets business requirements. Product managers work closely with the engineering team to ensure that the product meets the business requirements and that it is developed on time and within the allocated budget. They work with the engineers to define the product's technical requirements and help them prioritize which features to develop first.
4. Testing and validating the product to ensure it meets customer needs and business goals. Before a product is launched, a product manager must test and validate it to ensure that it meets the customer's needs. They need to ensure that the product is user-friendly, bug-free, and meets the business goals.
5. Managing the product launch and marketing efforts. After the product is developed and tested, the product manager needs to manage the launch and marketing efforts. They work with the marketing team to create a marketing plan for the product launch and ensure that the product is launched successfully.
6. Monitoring the products performance and making necessary adjustments to meet customer needs and business goals. After the product is launched, the product manager needs to monitor its performance and make necessary adjustments to meet the customer's needs and business goals. They need to track sales, user engagement, and customer feedback to determine how well the product is performing.

Product managers need to have a strong understanding of both technical and business aspects of a product. They also need to have excellent communication and collaboration skills to work effectively with both the engineering and business teams.

In summary, product managers play a crucial role in ensuring a products success by overseeing its development, launch, and post-launch performance. They are responsible for ensuring that the product meets the customer's needs, is technically sound, and meets business goals. The role of a product manager can be challenging, but it is also rewarding, as they get to see their product succeed in the market.
